The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services.

In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins.

For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer its products and services as designed.

While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201cThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition,\u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8\n\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source.

Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 116253, "end_char_idx": 118949, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dcaf969-7aa9-43fa-91d0-3dff7157b905": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dcaf969-7aa9-43fa-91d0-3dff7157b905", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2022.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "4a2ec5772c20b31ecd61beb3a75c24cbedc5cae65d6a3f13c01887aaeae4a06f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2bf500f-aa88-4c68-91f7-967567a9a199", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "33666bc00e3b9c7b7d719ab5f28afe7f2cb491e99436ccdd4c6cb8dba2fa4053", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f9650f9e-2858-4434-a605-bd93acd0987d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bde3e23e34db1a19c8ea76bf6a7ba641cfba184d8d6a9772d4c8d3fa68e78f7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars.

However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26\n\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27\n\nItem 8.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 120733, "end_char_idx": 123409, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07e1dab5-9a2d-4172-a107-d7242ea7733c": {"__data__": {"id_": "07e1dab5-9a2d-4172-a107-d7242ea7733c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2022.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "4a2ec5772c20b31ecd61beb3a75c24cbedc5cae65d6a3f13c01887aaeae4a06f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9650f9e-2858-4434-a605-bd93acd0987d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "b8da2b01d5d257cd9e73a0565cc6c4d76dda15f2f69bb59f64bdd5ca94e60fcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c8e4a6f-cab4-494c-93f2-5fe85d1c4bae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab10e4182bd077b71ff72e95e084eb4dc1509f58d5eddb07e8bc74e25556e2c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27\n\nItem 8.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 133824, "end_char_idx": 136252, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6233a69d-3e6d-4315-8b42-be3545f06607": {"__data__": {"id_": "6233a69d-3e6d-4315-8b42-be3545f06607", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2022.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "4a2ec5772c20b31ecd61beb3a75c24cbedc5cae65d6a3f13c01887aaeae4a06f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a6c21ad-ca76-4d0f-a253-79eedacb1001", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "8bb7934977b3c1c4be18a6b734eba3be42cc1b3c32c768b4cef60d7422279605", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c9d35ec-8644-475b-8b49-a159f80749ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1a3c34a15e389bd942c9baa9955ef54d17e93ed8eb882d84c9a8de5da249e62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.8 billion, of which $ 8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.\u2019s effective tax rate. In accounting for uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management\u2019s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.\u2019s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.\u2019s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.\u2019s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.\u2019s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n\n/s/\n\nWe have served as Apple Inc.\u2019s auditor since 2009.\n\nOctober 27, 2022\n\nApple Inc.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 136253, "end_char_idx": 138764, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c9d35ec-8644-475b-8b49-a159f80749ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c9d35ec-8644-475b-8b49-a159f80749ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2022.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "4a2ec5772c20b31ecd61beb3a75c24cbedc5cae65d6a3f13c01887aaeae4a06f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6233a69d-3e6d-4315-8b42-be3545f06607", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "67ecf8de54ae9c57714658fd03cefceec1a0bea45e71869aa34636a2d615c9ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1785398c-cf8f-44fa-abee-754fd5eb8ff0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3bd237bdc17d142bf850eb8705841f620a3a51152ec5386ca2c3e9e94a9ee16a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "tax personnel.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nOctober 27, 2022\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52\n\nItem 9.

Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\n\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

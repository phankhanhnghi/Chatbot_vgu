The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2021, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 36% and 64%, respectively, of total net sales.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 2\n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.

In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\n\nSupply of Components\n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 13868, "end_char_idx": 16816, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2d022ed-0d06-4210-ae09-6e92670df9aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2d022ed-0d06-4210-ae09-6e92670df9aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2021.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a268e5427dc0d9729cb3cbfa22d39b5ba7deb6f0cf74aa12f9f2ec1607a6623b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1391164-4490-4365-887f-3ad2baeeb90b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "eb26b0242fab737f0a6a2bff324dc14a807338a90ec586324dd924b3354972bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2527e070-3ff3-4486-9b5c-af7d6ec1a8aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "162f087d424a957b3a1b5e4ac98459d63a1400206c11c8f8a44c8c2420aa4358", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "and Ireland.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace.

This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\n\nThe Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.\n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services.

For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 80738, "end_char_idx": 83713, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1018355d-b427-403e-aacd-c30e9096cb8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1018355d-b427-403e-aacd-c30e9096cb8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2021.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a268e5427dc0d9729cb3cbfa22d39b5ba7deb6f0cf74aa12f9f2ec1607a6623b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3992581f-b813-4f0f-a2d5-1a57e3579070", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "ca43999e8c371f4251cb815abaee880f8e37898386bc6254f27f527a207971cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "222b6176-b1dc-4698-8543-9598f7271b42", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f2a76adcdf8c7344fda75ddaf6635aa3a4bb9a0f23ffbb41545fdda5486e535", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide.

In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.

Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company\u2019s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $118.7 billion and $107.4 billion, respectively.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 116568, "end_char_idx": 119170, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c03c7670-81ca-4325-80b7-02f6f5467d36": {"__data__": {"id_": "c03c7670-81ca-4325-80b7-02f6f5467d36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2021.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a268e5427dc0d9729cb3cbfa22d39b5ba7deb6f0cf74aa12f9f2ec1607a6623b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "efbc411a-f620-4e33-94d3-41459bd26f8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "5174d598b8ac9d5e74ecabe6f64bec4da561d3f4a7b1f32fbcb0514de89c7e10", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "46f3636e-5831-4ff0-9f22-794dec900761", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02254b01b525f04231d54244543257c7f75bdb651a9b3fc420d1c9f32cf3d190", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $118.7 billion and $107.4 billion, respectively.

A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 to increase by $186 million and $218 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26\n\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 118954, "end_char_idx": 121546, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46f3636e-5831-4ff0-9f22-794dec900761": {"__data__": {"id_": "46f3636e-5831-4ff0-9f22-794dec900761", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2021.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a268e5427dc0d9729cb3cbfa22d39b5ba7deb6f0cf74aa12f9f2ec1607a6623b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c03c7670-81ca-4325-80b7-02f6f5467d36", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6ce1dbe1888d379165312a5d970372a32f777e6c4530d3a6029be7cb1317f3b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae72f005-cd99-4fb4-915d-99286401fb0a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b55e7b3aacefae27fc1df04ae4c7db91d3245a8133f16697bca98759092400d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26\n\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 25, 2021 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 27\n\nItem 8.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 121232, "end_char_idx": 123006, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae72f005-cd99-4fb4-915d-99286401fb0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae72f005-cd99-4fb4-915d-99286401fb0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2021.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a268e5427dc0d9729cb3cbfa22d39b5ba7deb6f0cf74aa12f9f2ec1607a6623b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "46f3636e-5831-4ff0-9f22-794dec900761", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "5575534b06408beae88b14d7a7327ada79e1ad84b396970255a6e18c09ab0c7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "06445634-eb0c-4ce2-a924-f8b376792e35", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fdd87408fd66d6b5e8723baa39a3889d1bbb2ca0c5383137422e675449587eff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 27\n\nItem 8.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 133613, "end_char_idx": 136041, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71a7c5e2-1881-45c1-8f25-e1d4f8bc767b": {"__data__": {"id_": "71a7c5e2-1881-45c1-8f25-e1d4f8bc767b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2021.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a268e5427dc0d9729cb3cbfa22d39b5ba7deb6f0cf74aa12f9f2ec1607a6623b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e474f5a-1221-4bea-9223-b3dfaf9d0e0c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "bdfc0e93cd31a32d70af7cac983dfe47824546bfda1da5589f3a0b4a0f6c6f65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "349df178-6f5e-49a5-9fbe-5d856780c7ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec1819ab926548a8ed5050c078b4dcfe874d1412963e3d42296b0a2e90014902", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.\u2019s effective tax rate. Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of technical merits and complex tax laws. Auditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 52\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management\u2019s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.\u2019s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.\u2019s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.\u2019s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.\u2019s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as Apple Inc.\u2019s auditor since 2009.\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\nApple Inc.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 136042, "end_char_idx": 138603, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "349df178-6f5e-49a5-9fbe-5d856780c7ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "349df178-6f5e-49a5-9fbe-5d856780c7ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "AAPL2021.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a268e5427dc0d9729cb3cbfa22d39b5ba7deb6f0cf74aa12f9f2ec1607a6623b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "71a7c5e2-1881-45c1-8f25-e1d4f8bc767b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "9653e7724d72b256ecce0519177572ff86335c3a4a6815c825e6ea78bb50b44e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1fadbc8c-1f9c-4b92-a147-2468ca5bb664", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1547d16059b522c7c4d382988991e59950000fc9ace2e48d3b831f97bfe0a2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.\u2019s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as Apple Inc.\u2019s auditor since 2009.\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 53\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Apple Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the \u201cCOSO criteria\u201d).

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 54\n\nItem 9.

The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets;\n\n(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and\n\n(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
